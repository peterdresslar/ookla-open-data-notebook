# To summarize what we want to do, in one big script:
#     Get the list of territories
#     For each file (for each Quarter)
#     Get the file
#     Process into tiles
#       For each territory
#         Filter into smaller tiles
#         Get statistics
#         Write statistics to database
#         Write smaller tile to file
